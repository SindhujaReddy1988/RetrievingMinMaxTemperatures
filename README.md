# RetrievingMinMaxTemperatures
Retrieve the minimum and maximum temperature for the city from the 10 day forecast on weather.com. Find the difference between the  maximum and minimum temperature for each day. Pass the test case if the difference is less than 20 degree and fail if the difference is over  20. Each day should be considered as a separate test case.
